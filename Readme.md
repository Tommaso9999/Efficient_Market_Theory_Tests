to be able to run the scripts you can either activate the myenv environment by running source myenv/bin/activate on the terminal at this direcotry path or create your own with the following commands: 


# Create a virtual environment to run the app, navigate to this direcotry path (or open terminal in Vs Code)
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

*note: the process can take a couple of minutes. 



You should now be able to run the app.py file that will start the application! If you have any trouble feel free to contact me.
